send it to visualreview. Currently it is configured with host is nohost and will ignore the analyzeScreenshot command.
If you want to use visualreview and execute this test case, download visual review (https://github.com/xebia/VisualReview) 
start it with the start.sh. and change the value of nohost to local host.

'''Use the ''create visual analyze for project'' command and specify a project, suite, host and a portnumber'''
'''Use the ''analyzeScreenshot'' command and specify the name of the page'''

'''Executed steps:
1. Open the current page.
2. Verify the page title "${PAGE_NAME}".
3. Create a Screenshot of the browser window and send it to the visualreview.'''
